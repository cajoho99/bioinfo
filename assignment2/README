Purpose
-------

The C programs 'pdb_io.c', 'atom_array.c' and 'residue_array.c'  demonstrate
file handling and input/output.  


Description
-----------

The program 'pdb_io' takes the name of a Protein Data Bank (PDB) file as a
command line argument, reads each line of that file, splits up each ATOM line
into individual fields (placing their values in separate variables), then
writes out the contents of each ATOM line in three ways:

	1. (most of) the individual fields, one field per line;
	2. the single string containing the whole ATOM line (as read);
	3. (most of) the individual fields, in PDB format.

The program 'atom_array' first reads PDB atom records into an array of
"atom" structures, then writes out the content of this array in PDB format.

The program 'residue_array' first reads PDB atom records into an array of
"residue" structures, then writes out the content of this array in PDB format.

Later in this course you will write programs that have to read/write
Protein Data Bank files, and you might find it useful to use these
programs as a starting point.


These programs can be compiled using the Makefile (see below).
You don't *need* to understand (or even look at) the contents of the
Makefile, or how the 'make' utility works.  But, if you are interested,
there are some explanatory comments in the Makefile.


Instructions
------------

Copy the files from this directory into a directory of your own.
I recommend that you use a new directory for each practical.

To compile the programs, type:

	make

To run the programs with data file '1CRN.pdb', type:

	./pdb_io 1CRN.pdb
	./atom_array 1CRN.pdb
	./residue_array 1CRN.pdb

To remove those files that can be recompiled from the source code, type:

	make clean
